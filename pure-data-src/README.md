CEAMMC Puredata distribution 2017.05
-----------------

General purpose Pd distribution and library used for work and education purposes in Centre of electoacoustic music of Moscow Conservatory (CEAMMC) and ZIL-electro studio.

This repository is an assembly of Puredata that includes the CEAMMC library.

Key concepts
------------

   - All the externals are grouped by their function. This is different from the traditional approach but this aims to simplify the learning process and makes the language itself more clear.
   - Higher level set of objects for education and handy use in work process: oscillators, filters etc.
   - Library adds several features to basic Pd API. It is written in C++ and covered with tests.
   - Inclusion of some modern techniques. Library v0.1 includes comprehensive set of objects that work with lists and include some concepts from functional programming.


Features: v0.2
--------------

 * Core objects:
   - list.* objects: 32 objects that cover different techniques to work with lists
   - list.apply_to, list.reduce objects introduce basic functional approach to list processing.
   - math.* : 28 objects covering math functions with 1 argument
   - vector.* : basic vector operations
   - basic JSON handling
   - system.* object for various system features
   - flow control: pass, reject objects; predicates objects
   - random number generators
   - property concept: non-UI objects may have properties that can be accessed after object creation. This includes special message and prop.get object for handling
 * Audio objects:
   - dynamics: compressor, limiter, soft clip
   - envelope generators (ar, adsr) and follower
   - filters: eq peak and shelf filters, dc block, lp/hp/bp in 2- and 4-pole versions
   - filter coefficient calculations and biquad filter object with audio-rate control
   - oscillators and LFO with different waveforms. including sine oscillator with feedback
   - some basic effects - pitch/frequency shift, flanger, distortion
   - snd.file - object for importing sound files
 * GUI objects:
   - 8 new objects: knob, multiple slider box, 2d slider, keyboard, message display, scope and oscilloscope
   - breakpoint function object, working with envelope objects
   - Basic timeline objects: graphical cues in a patch
   - Includes several objects from CICM Cream Library
 * Extensions:
   - New objects toolbar (also works as edit mode indicator)
   - Saving subpatch as new patch
   - Multiple undo (beta)
   - Grid / Align to grid (beta)


Roadmap v0.3+:
-------------

 * Core objects:
   - custom data types:
   - 'String' data type. string.\* objects for common string manipulation functionality
   - 'Set' data type. data.set, set.\* objects to work with sets - unordered lists. conversion to list.
   - function.call and [function] objects - working with named functions in Pd
   - array.do, array.each - apply the function to each element of an array
   - math.\* - add functions with multiple arguments
 * GUI
   - new completely rewritten Qt-based GUI with MVC architecture
   - simplified object set
   - Zoom, grid, extended property handling, extended patching/clipboard/undo etc
   - embedded Python; API for python
